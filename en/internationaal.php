				<div class="col-md-9">
					<p class="p-lessMargin"><span style="font-weight: bold">Hypothesis:</span><br>
						In countries with a low power distance, like Austria, addressing someone with their professional title is very important. In countries with a high power distance it isn't that important. See the comparison in power distance on the image to the right. Austria is blue, Belgium is purple.<br><br>
						<span style="font-weight: bold">Research:</span><br>I've searched the following on Google: "address first name austria appropriate"<br><br>
						<span style="font-weight: bold">Result:</span>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>Titles are very important. Use last names and appropriate titles until specifically invited by your Austrian host or colleagues to use their first names.</li>
							<li>Herr/Frau + professional title + surname are used when initially addressing someone. Example: Herr Doctor Bauer.</li>
							<li>Frau + professional title + surname are also used when addressing the wife of a professional. Example: Frau Professor Schmidt.</li>
							<li>All women over 18 are addressed to as Frau, even if they are not married.</li>

				Cocaine trade comes over to Antwerp from the Netherlands. This because it's easier to get the drugs to the people and sell it. Antwerp is know for its cocaine trade, causing that Antwerp gets more attention from ciminal organisations, that were operational in Rotterdam. This is the same in the movie as in reality, we see that drugs trade is a problem primarely in Antwerp, because a lot of drugs are smuggled in our country through the harbor of Antwerp.

				<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Fights plagute the station area of Dendermonde</span><br>
				Just like in the movie you can see that young people can respond aggresive in certain enviroments. They see a challenge in violence and they want to proof that their gang is better than others. They don't care about the other people in their surroundings, because they think they're the centre of attention. We see this in an incident that happened in Dendermond. After a small fight that happened in a relatively small party, the situation escalated when they crossed each other in the city centre. Ofcourse their differences of opinion had to be solved once and for all and what's better than a scheduled fight at the trainstation. We deal with a certain kind of pride in this situation, Neither want to admit he/she was wrong, so the tension stays between the 2 and once in a while small incidents will happen involving them.

				<h1><span class="label label-danger"><i class="fas fa-equal"></i> 2 experienced cultural differences</span></h1>
				<p>1) In my 2nd year of high school I was the only Belgian in my class with other students of different nationalities. There is not really a cause for it, because the school was primarely known under people with a different nationality than Belgian, it is also a technical school that focusses on courses where you work with your hands a lot. When you have a job it can cause for a person to get isolated from the rest of the staff which causes that collaborations won't go as smooth as they would expect. As a result I learned to be able to work with people that have different nationality than mine which makes it easier to collaborate with others.</p>
				<p>2) When I was younger and didn't knew how to speak French, I went with my parent to the Ardennes on a camping. I never came in contact with the people that spoke French on the camping. When I got older I learned to speak French, I still didn't spoke to them because if they talked back to me they would speak to me very fast and fluent that I wouldn't understand what they were saying. So as a result I always had it difficult speaking French. On your job it can cause a language barrier where you won't understand each other. A possible solution could be to have a neutral language that everyone can understand and speak, like English in IT. And if that won't work they can use a tool to translate the text.</p>
